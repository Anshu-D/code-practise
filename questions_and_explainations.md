3. **What is PEP 8 and why is it important?**
   - **Answer**: PEP 8 is the Python Enhancement Proposal that provides guidelines for writing Python code.
   - **Explanation**: It's important because it helps maintain code readability and consistency across projects, making it easier for developers to collaborate.

4. **How do you install Python and set up a development environment?**
   - **Answer**: You can install Python from the official website and set up an IDE like PyCharm or use text editors like VS Code.
   - **Explanation**: The installation process involves downloading and running the installer. IDEs and editors provide features like syntax highlighting and debugging tools, enhancing productivity.

5. **Explain the difference between lists and tuples in Python.**
   - **Answer**: Lists are mutable (changeable), while tuples are immutable (unchangeable).
   - **Explanation**: Lists can be modified after creation (add, remove, or change elements), whereas tuples cannot be altered once defined, making them useful for fixed collections of items.

6. **What are dictionaries in Python?**
   - **Answer**: Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs.
   - **Explanation**: They allow you to store data in a way that maps a unique key to a specific value, like a real-world dictionary where words (keys) map to definitions (values).

7. **How does Python handle memory management?**
   - **Answer**: Python uses automatic memory management, including garbage collection.
   - **Explanation**: This means Python automatically allocates and deallocates memory, freeing up resources that are no longer needed, which simplifies programming.

8. **Explain the concept of Python namespaces.**
   - **Answer**: A namespace is a container that holds a set of identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.) and their associated objects.
   - **Explanation**: Namespaces help avoid naming conflicts by ensuring that each identifier is unique within its scope.

9. **What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?**
   - **Answer**: A shallow copy creates a new object but inserts references into it to the objects found in the original. A deep copy creates a new object and recursively copies all objects found in the original.
   - **Explanation**: Shallow copies are faster but may cause issues if the copied objects are mutable, while deep copies are safer but more time-consuming.

10. **What are Python modules and packages?**
    - **Answer**: Modules are files containing Python code, while packages are collections of modules.
    - **Explanation**: Modules allow you to organize your code into separate files for better manageability, and packages group related modules together.

### Data Types and Operations
11. **Explain the different data types in Python.**
    - **Answer**: Common data types include integers (whole numbers), floats (decimal numbers), strings (text), lists (ordered collections), tuples (immutable collections), dictionaries (key-value pairs), and sets (unordered collections).
    - **Explanation**: Each data type serves a specific purpose, helping you represent different kinds of data effectively.

12. **How can you convert a string to an integer in Python?**
    - **Answer**: Use the `int()` function.
    - **Explanation**: For example, `int("123")` converts the string "123" to the integer 123.

13. **What is the difference between ‘==’ and ‘is’ operators?**
    - **Answer**: `==` checks for value equality, while `is` checks for identity (whether they are the same object in memory).
    - **Explanation**: Two variables can have the same value (`==`), but be different objects (`is`).

14. **How do you use the `range()` function in Python?**
    - **Answer**: The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, often used in loops.
    - **Explanation**: For example, `range(5)` generates numbers from 0 to 4. It’s useful for iterating over a specific number of times.

15. **What are list comprehensions? Provide an example.**
    - **Answer**: List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.
    - **Explanation**: Example: `[x*2 for x in range(5)]` creates a list `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]` by doubling each number from 0 to 4.

### Control Flow
16. **How do you write a conditional statement in Python?**
    - **Answer**: Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` keywords.
    - **Explanation**: Example:
      ```python
      if x > 0:
          print("Positive")
      elif x == 0:
          print("Zero")
      else:
          print("Negative")
      ```

17. **Explain the use of `for` and `while` loops with examples.**
    - **Answer**: `for` loops iterate over a sequence, while `while` loops run as long as a condition is true.
    - **Explanation**:
      ```python
      for i in range(5):
          print(i)  # Prints 0 to 4
      ```

      ```python
      while x < 5:
          print(x)
          x += 1  # Runs until x is no longer less than 5
      ```

18. **What are the `break`, `continue`, and `pass` statements in Python?**
    - **Answer**: `break` exits a loop, `continue` skips the current iteration, and `pass` does nothing.
    - **Explanation**:
      ```python
      for i in range(5):
          if i == 3:
              break  # Exits loop when i is 3
          print(i)

      for i in range(5):
          if i == 3:
              continue  # Skips printing 3
          print(i)

      if x > 0:
          pass  # Placeholder for future code
      ```

19. **How do you handle exceptions in Python? Provide an example.**
    - **Answer**: Using `try`, `except`, `finally` blocks.
    - **Explanation**:
      ```python
      try:
          x = 1 / 0
      except ZeroDivisionError:
          print("Cannot divide by zero")
      finally:
          print("This runs no matter what")
      ```

20. **What are the common built-in exceptions in Python?**
    - **Answer**: Examples include `ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`, `TypeError`, `IndexError`, `KeyError`.
    - **Explanation**: These exceptions help handle common errors gracefully, allowing the program to continue running or fail gracefully.

### Functions
21. **How do you define a function in Python?**
    - **Answer**: Using the `def` keyword.
    - **Explanation**:
      ```python
      def my_function():
          print("Hello, world!")
      ```

22. **What are *args and **kwargs?**
    - **Answer**: `*args` allows passing a variable number of positional arguments, while `**kwargs` allows passing a variable number of keyword arguments.
    - **Explanation**:
      ```python
      def func(*args):
          for arg in args:
              print(arg)

      def func(**kwargs):
          for key, value in kwargs.items():
              print(key, value)
      ```

23. **What is the difference between a function and a method?**
    - **Answer**: A function is a block of code that performs a task, while a method is a function associated with an object.
    - **Explanation**: Methods are called on objects and can modify the object's state, whereas functions are standalone.

24. **Explain the concept of lambda functions. Provide an example.**
    - **Answer**: Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined with the `lambda` keyword.
    - **Explanation**:
      ```python
      add = lambda x, y: x + y
      print(add(2, 3))  # Outputs 5
      ```

25. **What are decorators in Python? Provide an example.**
    - **Answer**: Decorators modify the behavior of a function or method.
    - **Explanation**:
      ```python
      def decorator_func(original_func):
          def wrapper_func():
              print("Before function execution")
              original_func()
              print("After function execution")
          return wrapper_func

      @decorator_func
      def display():
          print("Inside the function")

      display()
      ```

### Object-Oriented Programming
26. **What is OOP? How does Python support OOP?**
    - **Answer**: OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming, which organizes code into objects and classes.
    - **Explanation**: Python supports OOP through classes and objects, allowing
